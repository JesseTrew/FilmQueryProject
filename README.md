## Film Query App Project

### Week 7 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

You will create a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. It will be menu-based, allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data.

All JDBC code will be encapsulated in methods of the com.skilldistillery.filmquery.database.DatabaseAccessorObject class. As you need new database access methods, declare them first in the DatabaseAccessor interface, then implement them in DatabaseAccessorObject. Methods should return objects like Film, Actor, and List<Actor>, not String or List<String>.

All user input and display output will be in methods of com.skilldistillery.filmquery.app.FilmQueryApp.

### How to Run
Run from the file FilmQueryApp. Follow on-screen prompts and input requested data.

### Technologies/Topics Used
We are beginning to dive into databases using MySQL and dabbling with JDBC and the DAO object model design.


### Lessons Learned
This is all still a good bit over my head, but it's nice that I can at least see that things are coming together in a useful way. For example, accessing databases and manipulating the data is a fairly universally practical skill set for any organization.

Otherwise, my main lesson learned is on time management. I thought I had the original deadline for certain, but I put off wrapping up the project until way too late in the weekend, and after sitting down to finish it, I realized how much work there actually was left to do.

So my biggest takeaways (aside from all of the new tech and tools we're learning) is to give myself more time than I think I'll need to complete something and to be extra thorough with an emphasis on attention to detail. If a journalist misses a hyphen on a compound adjective in an article, even at an important publication, most people probably won't notice. But if a programmer misses a semicolon (or has an ambiguous reference) then their program might completely crash and burn
